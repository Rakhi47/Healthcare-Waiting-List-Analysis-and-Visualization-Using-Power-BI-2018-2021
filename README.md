## Data Collection
The data collected for this project spans multiple years (2018-2021) and consists of key metrics related to hospital patient waiting lists. The datasets contain the following columns: Archive_Date, Speciality_HIPE, Speciality, Adult_Child, Age_Profile, Time_Band, and Total. Each dataset represents snapshots of patient waiting lists, categorized by medical specialty, age profiles, and waiting times.

The data is structured to provide insights into:

Medical Specialties: Information is organized by different medical specialties to analyze demand and waiting times within various departments.
Demographics: Distinctions are made between adult and child patients, alongside detailed age profiles, helping to understand the population distribution.
Time Bands: This shows the distribution of patients by waiting time, categorized into bands to track how long patients are waiting for treatments or consultations.
Yearly Comparisons: Data collected over the years 2018 to 2021 enables year-on-year comparisons, highlighting trends and changes in healthcare waiting times and patient demographics.
This dataset serves as a foundation for understanding the operational dynamics of hospital waiting lists, patient demographics, and the workload across medical specialties over time.
